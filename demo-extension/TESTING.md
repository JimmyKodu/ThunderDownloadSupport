This document describes how to test the newly implemented silent background download feature in the demo extension.

## Feature Summary

The extension now:
1. ‚úÖ Intercepts qualifying downloads (>2MB, monitored file types, not blacklisted domains)
2. ‚úÖ Cancels the original browser download
3. ‚úÖ Automatically starts a silent background download
4. ‚úÖ Saves files to `ThunderDownloads` subfolder in browser's download directory
5. ‚úÖ Shows real-time download progress in the popup

## Prerequisites

1. Chrome or Chromium-based browser (Edge, Brave, etc.)
2. Demo extension loaded in developer mode
3. Access to download test files (>2MB in size)

3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `demo-extension` folder
5. Verify the extension appears in the extension list

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Basic Interception and Download

**Objective**: Verify that downloads are intercepted and downloaded to ThunderDownloads folder

**Steps**:
1. Find a website with a downloadable file >2MB (e.g., .zip, .exe)
2. Click the download link
3. Observe the browser's download behavior

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Original download is canceled immediately
- ‚úÖ Extension badge shows active download count (green badge)
- ‚úÖ Click extension icon to see download progress
- ‚úÖ File appears in `Downloads/ThunderDownloads/` folder when complete
- ‚úÖ Badge updates to show completion (blue badge)

### Test Case 2: Progress Monitoring

**Objective**: Verify real-time progress updates

**Steps**:
1. Start downloading a large file (10MB+)
2. Immediately open the extension popup
3. Watch the download progress

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Download item shows "‚¨áÔ∏è ‰∏ãËΩΩ‰∏≠" status
- ‚úÖ Progress bar updates in real-time
- ‚úÖ Percentage and bytes received/total are displayed
- ‚úÖ Stats section shows 1 downloading
- ‚úÖ When complete, status changes to "‚úÖ Â∑≤ÂÆåÊàê"
- ‚úÖ Stats section shows 1 completed

### Test Case 3: Multiple Simultaneous Downloads

**Objective**: Test handling of multiple concurrent downloads

**Steps**:
1. Start 3-5 downloads from different sites
2. Open extension popup
3. Observe statistics and individual download progress

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ All downloads tracked separately
- ‚úÖ Badge shows count of active downloads
- ‚úÖ Stats show correct count of downloading items
- ‚úÖ Each download has its own progress bar
- ‚úÖ Downloads complete independently

### Test Case 4: File Type Filtering

**Objective**: Verify only monitored file types are intercepted

**Steps**:
1. Try downloading various file types:
   - ‚úÖ .exe (should intercept)
   - ‚úÖ .zip (should intercept)
   - ‚úÖ .rar (should intercept)
   - ‚úÖ .iso (should intercept)
   - ‚ùå .pdf (should NOT intercept)
   - ‚ùå .jpg (should NOT intercept)
   - ‚ùå .mp4 (should NOT intercept)

**Expected Results**:
- Only monitored extensions (.exe, .zip, .rar, .7z, .iso, .dmg, .pkg, .deb, .rpm, .apk) are intercepted
- Other file types download normally through browser

### Test Case 5: File Size Filtering

**Objective**: Verify minimum file size threshold

**Steps**:
1. Download a .zip file <2MB (e.g., 1MB)
2. Download a .zip file >2MB (e.g., 5MB)

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Small file (<2MB) downloads normally through browser
- ‚úÖ Large file (>2MB) is intercepted and downloaded to ThunderDownloads

### Test Case 6: Domain Blacklist

**Objective**: Verify blacklisted domains are not intercepted

**Steps**:
1. Try downloading from blacklisted domains:
   - youtube.com
   - youku.com
   - bilibili.com
   - iqiyi.com
2. Try downloading from non-blacklisted domain

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Downloads from blacklisted domains proceed normally
- ‚úÖ Downloads from other domains are intercepted

### Test Case 7: Download Failure Handling

**Objective**: Test error handling for failed downloads

**Steps**:
1. Start a download, then disconnect network
2. Or try downloading from an invalid/broken URL

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Download status shows "‚ùå Â§±Ë¥•"
- ‚úÖ Error message displayed in download details
- ‚úÖ Stats show 1 failed download
- ‚úÖ Badge updates appropriately

### Test Case 8: Enable/Disable Toggle

**Objective**: Verify interception can be disabled

**Steps**:
1. Open extension popup
2. Click "Á¶ÅÁî®Êã¶Êà™ (Disable Interception)" button
3. Try downloading a file that would normally be intercepted
4. Re-enable and try again

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ When disabled: downloads proceed normally through browser
- ‚úÖ When enabled: downloads are intercepted as usual
- ‚úÖ Status indicator updates correctly

### Test Case 9: Clear History

**Objective**: Verify history clearing works

**Steps**:
1. Intercept several downloads
2. Open extension popup
3. Click "Ê∏ÖÈô§ÂéÜÂè≤ (Clear History)" button
4. Confirm the action

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ All download records removed from list
- ‚úÖ Stats reset to zero
- ‚úÖ Badge cleared
- ‚úÖ Active downloads continue in the background and are not affected (they will still complete normally)

### Test Case 10: File Naming and Conflicts

**Objective**: Test file naming when conflicts occur

**Steps**:
1. Download the same file twice
2. Check the ThunderDownloads folder

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ First download: `filename.ext`
- ‚úÖ Second download: `filename (1).ext` (auto-uniquified)
- ‚úÖ Both files saved successfully
